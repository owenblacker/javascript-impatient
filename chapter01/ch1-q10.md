# Chapter 1, question 10

> What happens when an array of arrays is converted to a string?

```javascript
// Example from Ch1 §1.14, page 20
const melancholyMagicSquare = [
    [16, 3, 2, 13],
    [5, 10, 11, 8],
    [9, 6, 7, 12],
    [4, 15, 14, 1],
]

console.log('Just output:')
console.log(melancholyMagicSquare)
console.log('\nAnd stringified:')
console.log(JSON.stringify(melancholyMagicSquare))
console.log('\nAnd forcibly cast:')
console.log('' + melancholyMagicSquare)
```

Output:

```text
Just output:
[
  [ 16, 3, 2, 13 ],
  [ 5, 10, 11, 8 ],
  [ 9, 6, 7, 12 ],
  [ 4, 15, 14, 1 ]
]

And stringified:
[[16,3,2,13],[5,10,11,8],[9,6,7,12],[4,15,14,1]]

And forcibly cast:
16,3,2,13,5,10,11,8,9,6,7,12,4,15,14,1
```

So `console.log` does a good job of useful output, including colouring the numbers in a MacOS terminal. `JSON.stringify` unsurprisingly maintains the 2-dimensional structure but outputs an unspaced array-of-arrays. Forcibly casting to string loses the 2D structure and outputs a flattened TSV.

Repeating with an array of typed array-values:

```javascript
const typedMagicSquare = [
    [16, 3, 2, 13],
    [5, '10', 11, 8],
    [9, 6, '7', 12],
    [4, 0xf, 14, 1],
]

console.log('\nTyped array to console:')
console.log(typedMagicSquare)
console.log('\nTyped and stringified:')
console.log(JSON.stringify(typedMagicSquare))
console.log('\nAnd forcibly cast again:')
console.log('' + typedMagicSquare)
```

Gives us:

```text
Typed array to console:
[
  [ 16, 3, 2, 13 ],
  [ 5, '10', 11, 8 ],
  [ 9, 6, '7', 12 ],
  [ 4, 15, 14, 1 ]
]

Typed and stringified:
[[16,3,2,13],[5,"10",11,8],[9,6,"7",12],[4,15,14,1]]

And forcibly cast again:
16,3,2,13,5,10,11,8,9,6,7,12,4,15,14,1
```

This shows both `console.log` and `JSON.stringify` maintaining the distinction between numbers and strings-of-numbers (though converting the hex literal to a denary value) and the forced-conversion losting that distinction — unsurprisingly, given that all that output is a single string.
