# Chapter 2, question 15

> Conside the problem of finding the first position in which an array `b` occurs as a sub-sequence of an array `a`.
>
> Write two nested loops:
>
> ```javascript
> let result = undefined
> for (let i = 0; i < a.length - b.length; i++) {
>    for (let j = 0; j < b.length; j++) {
>      if (a[i + j] != b[j]) ...
>    }
>    ...
> }
> ```
>
> Complete with labeled `break` and `continue` statements. Then rewrite without `break` or `continue`.
